# Liberty for indoor cycling!

**Freedom is why we ride.** CYCARLA is about:

+ **Freedom** to explore the world, just like riding outside. 
+ **Freedom** to modify the game: The entire codebase is open source.
+ **Free** as in free beer! This project is backed by donations and community support.

Bring your Bluetooth-compatible indoor cycling accessories and liberate your indoor riding!

# Getting Started

You'll need the following equipment to ride in CYCARLA:

1. A bike, such as [this absolute beauty](https://www.bastioncycles.com/)
2. Steering plate, such as [Elite Sterzo](https://www.elite-it.com/en/products/home-trainers/ecosystem-accessories/sterzo-smart)
3. Smart Trainer, such as [Elite Suito T](https://www.elite-it.com/en/products/home-trainers/interactive-trainers/suito-t)
4. A GPU-equipped computer running Linux, such as [this System76 laptop](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx)

## Computer Requirements

Basically, you'll need a gaming computer.

+ CPU: Intel Core i5 or better
+ GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2070 or better (2080, 3060, 3070, 3080, etc.)
+ Hard drive: 10GB of free space.
+ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support
+ Internet connection required for installation, not required to run the game.

Currently, CYCARLA is developed on and for Debian-family Linux (Ubuntu, PopOS).

Keep in mind CYCARLA is based on a serious 3D game engine with full customizability, so it'll be more demanding than typical indoor cycling games.

# [Community on Discord]()

CYCARLA began two years ago as a fun 'future of cycling vision' demo at the [Bike2CAV](https://www.bike2cav.at/en/home-2/) consortium presentation at Salzburg Research. Since then it has been my passion project.

Users, contributors, and anyone else interested in this project are invited to the Discord, [so join us there!]()

# Errata

CYCARLA is also stylized 'CyCARLA' or 'Cycarla'

It is pronounced: *"sai-karla"*
