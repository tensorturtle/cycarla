# Liberty for indoor cycling!

**Freedom is why we ride.** CYCARLA is about:

+ **Freedom** to explore the world, just like riding outside. 
+ **Freedom** to modify the game: The entire codebase is open source.

Bring your Bluetooth-compatible indoor cycling accessories and liberate your indoor riding!
